# Gaps and Next Steps (All From Iterations and Repo)

## Gaps
- Exact birth/death for Edward Jr.
- Full family tree for Richard's other children.
- Unindexed society records for oil/lumber business.
- Undigitized Records: Transylvania Co. Superior Court/SC county courts (1916-1921; require in-person); incomplete appellate (miss settled/non-appealed cases); jurisdictional ambiguity (NC dam/SC damage).
- Sparse Documentation: Low toll/rural setting reduced records; newspapers event-focused, not outcomes.
- Timeframe: 1916-1921 may miss later; no evidence in NC Appeals (post-1967) or Buncombe Co.
- Digitization: Limited Pittsburgh papers (e.g., Press/Post from 1910); ~928 loc.gov results but many unrelated (e.g., LA publisher).
- Vitals: Paywalled censuses (1860-1930); obscured dates; no military.
- Confirmations: Most facts count 1 (e.g., Spokane Press); no new articles linking businesses.
- Tools: browse_page failures (dynamic elements, 503 errors); view_image fails on JP2/PDF (format issues); high result counts (e.g., 744K misparse).

## Next Steps (All Recommendations Compiled)
- Contact Transylvania Historical Society (info@tchistoricalsociety.org) for Toxaway files.
- Contact Armstrong Historical Society (achmgs@gmail.com) for tax/microfilm on Jennings oil.
- Search FamilySearch for Richard Jr.'s 1940 census (post-1930, but for lineage).
- loc.gov: Refine with state filters (PA/NC); use "E H Jennings"/"EH Jennings" (avoid "E*H*Jennings" for OCR/wildcards); paginated URLs (19 pages generated); browse more (e.g., page 2); view_image on JP2s for custom OCR around "Jennings" (e.g., Sylva NC papers for dam).
- Court: Contact Transylvania Co. Clerk (www.nccourts.gov, 828-885-3000) for dockets/minute books; NC State Archives (archives.ncdcr.gov, 919-814-6840); SC Judicial Branch (www.sccourts.org) or clerks (Pickens: 864-898-5598, Oconee: 864-638-4155); National Archives Atlanta (atlanta.archives@nara.gov, 770-968-2100) for federal (Identifier 2715069); investigate 1911 foreclosure links.
- Local: Transylvania Historical Society (www.tchistoricalsociety.org); Transylvania Library Rowell Bosse Room (828-884-1820, laura.gardner@transylvaniacounty.org) for docs/oral histories; microfilmed Brevard News/Asheville Citizen-Times at NC Archives.
- Harvard: Email specialcollectionsref@hbs.edu for R.G. Dun name search (provide topic, names, geography like PA/NC; accept fees; complete application); use HOLLIS for other collections.
- Ancestry: Access full for censuses; cross-reference vitals (e.g., Griffin in 1910 Pittsburgh).
- Professional: Hire legal historian/genealogist for unindexed records; Westlaw/Lexis if available.
- Repo: Update with new loc.gov samples (e.g., Jackson County Journal for NC dam context).
- General: Share plaintiff names/case types for refinement; authorize site-restricted web_search on chroniclingamerica.loc.gov if browsing fails.
