# Gaps and Next Steps in E.H. Jennings Research

Major Gaps: Exact birth/death, full family tree, documents/photos.  

Next Steps:
- Search "Edward Henry Jennings death before 1930" on genealogy sites.
- Provide past Grok chat transcripts for integration.
- Explore DNA testing for relatives.
- Contact historical societies in suspected regions (e.g., New York/Pennsylvania).
