# Gaps and Next Steps in E.H. Jennings Research

Major Gaps: Exact birth/death for Edward Jr.; full family tree for Richard's other children; unindexed society records for oil/lumber business.

Next Steps:  
- Contact Transylvania Historical Society (info@tchistoricalsociety.org) for Toxaway files.
- Contact Armstrong Historical Society (achmgs@gmail.com) for tax/microfilm on Jennings oil.
- Search FamilySearch for Richard Jr.'s 1940 census (post-1930, but for lineage).
