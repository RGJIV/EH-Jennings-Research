FOUND DEAD IN HOME.  
Pittsburg oil official, E. H. Jennings, Jr., held probable suicide. Pittsburgh, September 4.—E. H. Jennings, Jr., vice president of the Pure Oil Co., and son of the late E. H. Jennings, was found dead in his Pittsburgh home yesterday, a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to the coroner’s report. Jennings was a prominent figure in the oil industry, having followed his father, E. H. Jennings, in managing Pure Oil’s operations. The Jennings family also held interests in the Federal Oil Co. and the Transylvania Oil Syndicate. His death is a significant loss to the industry. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Jennings, and two children. Funeral services will be held tomorrow at Pittsburgh’s First Presbyterian Church, with interment in Allegheny Cemetery.

Notes: Post-1930 event for Jr.; highlights father's pre-1930 legacy in oil syndicates. No mention of age 61 or illness.
