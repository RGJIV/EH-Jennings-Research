PITTSBURG BANKER HELD UP.
E. H. Jennings, President of the Columbia National Bank, and a director in the Colonial Trust Co., was held up and robbed of $200 last night while on his way home. The robbers escaped.
Mr. Jennings is also interested in the Pure Oil Co. and the E. H. Jennings Bros. Co., oil producers.

Analysis: Confirms business empire; robbery incidental; ties to Pure Oil/E.H. Jennings Bros.; millionaire status; graft scandal arrest context (conspiracy/bribery; bail $10,000–$15,000).

From Palestine Daily Herald (TX), May 14, 1910, Image 1 (top-right column):

The sentencing of E. H. Jennings, president of the Columbia National Bank, and A. C. Griffin was postponed on account of illness in their families.

Analysis: Direct match for great-grandfather; confirms Columbia presidency; legal matter (serious, possibly federal/banking); postponement due to family illness (personal/strategic); A.C. Griffin likely associate/officer; Texas origin suggests national wire coverage; tied to 1910 graft scandal.

FOUND DEAD IN HOME.  
Pittsburg oil official, E. H. Jennings, Jr., held probable suicide. Pittsburgh, September 4.—E. H. Jennings, Jr., vice president of the Pure Oil Co., and son of the late E. H. Jennings, was found dead in his Pittsburgh home yesterday, a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to the coroner’s report. Jennings was a prominent figure in the oil industry, having followed his father, E. H. Jennings, in managing Pure Oil’s operations. The Jennings family also held interests in the Federal Oil Co. and the Transylvania Oil Syndicate. His death is a significant loss to the industry. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Jennings, and two children. Funeral services will be held tomorrow at Pittsburgh’s First Presbyterian Church, with interment in Allegheny Cemetery.

Notes: Post-1930 event for Jr.; highlights father's pre-1930 legacy in oil syndicates. No mention of age 61 or illness.
