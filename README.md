# EH-Jennings-Research

This repository documents research on Edward Henry Jennings (E. H. Jennings, Sr.), a Pittsburgh industrialist active in oil, banking, and real estate from the 1880s to the 1920s, who died before 1930. Focus: Business empire (e.g., Pure Oil Co., Columbia National Bank, Colonial Trust Co., E. H. Jennings Bros. Co., Federal Oil Co., Transylvania Oil Syndicate, Toxaway Company), legal cases (e.g., 1916 Toxaway Dam failure, 1921 Commissioners v. Jennings, 1910 sentencing delay with A.C. Griffin), family lineage (PA/NC vitals, multi-generational ties), and historical context. Primary sources: Library of Congress (loc.gov/Chronicling America), Ancestry.com vitals, North Carolina Reports, Harvard Baker Library guides, and regional archives.

All facts have confirmation counts (mostly 1, from single sources like newspapers); no major updates beyond initial findings due to digitization gaps. Excludes unrelated Jennings (e.g., LA publisher, post-1930 events except Jr.'s 1931 obit for legacy).
